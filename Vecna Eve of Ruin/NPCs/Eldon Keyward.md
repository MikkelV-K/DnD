*First encountered in [[Ch. 1]] relevant to [[Save the Kidnapped Nobles]] and [[Escape Evernight]]*
## Role
Kidnapped noble in [[Neverwinter]] which is transported with the party to [[Evernight]] in [[The Shadowfell]].


## First Encounter
The characters find Eldon dangling in a cage in the Sacrifice Gallery meanwhile the cult is conducting a ritual underneath him.

Later Eldon gets dragged with the characters to [[Evernight]] stuck in a coffin. He gets out after a minute if not helped by the characters. He can then share information about [[Evernight]], why they ended up there and how they might get back to [[Neverwinter]] (see book page 30).

## Details
A highly knowledgeable scholar who specializes in the Outer Planes. He's a lawful good elf priest who follows Deneir. 
## The Notebook
He has a notebook filled with cramped writing about extraplanar intersection, planar conjunctions and similar esoterica. This can be found in the vacant cell C18 in the Neverdeath Catacombs. 
If returned to Eldon he's grateful and immediately starts adding notes about [[The Shadowfell]] and [[Evernight]].
