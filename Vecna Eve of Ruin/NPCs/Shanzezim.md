![[Shanzezim.webp]]

*First encountered in [[Ch. 1]] and relevant in [[Save the Kidnapped Nobles]]*

## Role
Resides in [[The Neverdeath Catacombs]] and can aid the characters with information.

## First Encounter
The characters encounter Shanzezim in his workshop. If the water elemental in the fountain has fled here and told him about intruders he will attack the characters in sight to drive them away. It surrenders if brought beneath 100 HP.  If not warned he first asks what the characters want.
If the characters reassure him they are not from the cult he offers them a gold-colored flywheel from the disassembled clock. It is not a part of the clock and has the propertied of a [[Stone of Good Luck]].

## Details
Shanzezim was bound by the Waterclock Guild and can't leave the crypts belonging to the organisation, even though it believes the guild has been defunct for years. As he does not feel quite ready to try to escape it spends time trying to reassemble one of the Waterclock Guild's most intricate clocks. 

## Information
- _Clock Assembly_
	- Shanzezim decided to reassemble a mechanical clock left behind by the guild. It thinks it should not take more than another few years, which does not bother it as it likes doing it.
- _Cult Activity_
	- Cruel cultists bully the Elementals in the next room and are keeping a gnome prisoner nearby.
- _Waterclock Guild_
	- Shanzezim is bound to a portion of the catacombs once controlled by a vanished organisation of artificers and geomancers called the Waterclock Guild. Additional guild catacombs lie past the collapsed portion of this room, but they hold nothing of interest.
