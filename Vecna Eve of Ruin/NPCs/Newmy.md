*Encountered in the [[Dolindar Tomb]], [[Ch. 1]] quest [[Escape Evernight]]*

## Role
- Newmy can give some information about the [[Dolindar Tomb]].


## First Encounter
The characters encounter Newmy if they approach her door in the [[Dolindar Tomb]] where it says "Newmy's Room".

## Details
Newmy is a _lawful neutral_ **ghost** who once was a moon elf. She can cast _Prestidigitation_ at will. Newmy is not quite five feet tall and is not interested in fighting since fights make messes.

## Information
- **Crypt cleaner:** The Dolindar's hires Newmy and paid her several lifetimes worth of wages up-front to keep their tomb clean shortly after it was built - more years ago than Newmy can remember. When she died she returned as a **ghost** to continue her duties.
- **Lonely Family:** The Dolindars were all lonely and there were not many of them. They didn't like [[Evernight]] but could not leave for some reason.
- **Puzzle Buttons:** Newmy doesn't know anything about a rift or a [[Crevice of Dusk]], but she remembers some "puzzle buttons" deeper in the tomb that she doesn't know how to work. Maybe they lead somewhere special.
- **Restless Dead:** Newmy does not go through the doors at the end of the hall anymore. The Dolindars buried down there "aren't resting right" and Newmy is afraid of them. She hasn't been that way in years and doesn't remember what's there.
