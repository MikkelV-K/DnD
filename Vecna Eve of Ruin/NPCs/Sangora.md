*First encountered in at the [[The Corpse Market]] in [[Evernight]], [[Ch. 1]] quest [[Escape Evernight]]*


## Role
Aids the characters with information to escape [[Evernight]] at a price of information or gold in return.

## First Encounter
The characters first encounter Sangora in [[The Corpse Market]] outside of her shop Sangora Sanguinaries. She sells the character information at a steep price but is not looking for a fight.
If the characters don't want to talk to her [[Eldon Keyward]] blurts out a question about finding a Crevice of Dusk.

## Details
She is a centuries old vampire with sunken eyes and a shock of long white hair. She is inquisitive and happy to gossip.


## Information
Sangora can give information to the characters. She charges 20 gp for each question she answers, but she also accepts an answer to a probing question instead of payment.
What she wants to know:
- Where are the characters from?
- How did they get here?
- What are they looking for in Evernight?
What she can answer:
- **Everninght:** Background on the city of [[Evernight]].
- **Neverwinter:** She knows [[Neverwinter]] as it was over a decade ago. At the time the populace viewed [[Dagult Neverember]] as a manipulative tyrant. She knows gateways called Crevices of Dusk sometimes appear in [[Evernight]] allowing passage to [[Neverwinter]].
- **Crevices of Dusk:** Residents of [[Neverwinter]] and [[Evernight]] dislike these portals being used indiscriminately. Those who know the locations of Crevices of Dusk either guard or hide them.
- **Stable Crevice of Dusk:** She tilts her head and gives a thoughtful look before giving true directions for one in the [[Dolindar Tomb]].
- **Dolindars:** They where exiled to [[The Shadowfell]] for reasons never shared. The family studied wizardry and knew much about planar gates despite never being able to use due to a family curse. They were lonely and miserable in life.
