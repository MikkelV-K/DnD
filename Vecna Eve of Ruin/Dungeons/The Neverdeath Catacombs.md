- **Ceilings:** The ceilings are 10 feet high in passages and 15 feet in rooms.
- **Doors:** Doors throughout the area are made of heavy stone with metal hinges. They are well oiled, so they don't make much noise when opened. Most are unlocked.

- **Vestiges of the Waterclock guild:** The sound of water dripping can be heard where there are pipes.
## History
